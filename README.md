# Kaboom  
A game like the classic Asteroids game, this is my first project on GitHub, and my first one using Git version control. Hope you like it!

When I'm finished with this I will fork this project in .exe and .app for Windows and MacOS, respectively.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Pygame 2.0 
```
pip install pygame
```
```
python -m pip install --user pygame
```

**Controls:**
* WASD to move
* Mouse to aim
* Space to fire

*Its **That** Simple!*
## Have Fun!!
