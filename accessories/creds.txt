This project could not have been done without the help of the following:

Stack Overflow (obviously),
    for all of the countless tutorials that helps every programmer with any project, 
    and for its diverse community.

Pygame, 
    for providing the framework on which this game was made.

And thanks all the other helpful websites out there.

But most importantly,
Last but definitely not least,
Python Software Corporation,
    for developing the powerful programming language known as Python,
    and for creating libraries that grant an incredible amount amount of power on the computer.

Without these things, this would not have been possible.
